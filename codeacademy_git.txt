1. A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
2. A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory
3. A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

git init - creates a new Git repository
git status - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
git diff - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
git commit - permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
git log - shows a list of all previous commits
git show HEAD - In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit.
        The output of this command will display everything the git log command displays for the HEAD commit, plus all the file changes that were committed.
        
git checkout HEAD filename - will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit.
git add filename_1 filename_2 - adding few file simultaneously
git reset HEAD filename - unstage file from a staging area

Creating a project is like hiking in a dark forest. Sometimes you take a wrong turn, then another wrong turn. Before you know it, you're surrounded by bears.

Git enables you to rewind to the part before you made the wrong turn and create a new destiny for the project. You can do this with:

git reset SHA (git reset 5d69206) - resets to a commit SHA (first 7 digits of commit code)
