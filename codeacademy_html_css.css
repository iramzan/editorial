As we mentioned, certain selectors will "override" others if they have a greater specificity value.
ul li p { is more specific CSS than just p {, so when CSS sees tags that are both <p> tags and happen
to be inside unordered lists, it will apply the more specific styling (ul li p {) to the text inside the lists.

/* PSEUDO SELECTORS

A pseudo-class selector is a way of accessing HTML items that aren't part of the document tree
(remember the tree structure we talked about earlier?). For instance, it's very easy to see where
a link is in the tree. But where would you find information about whether a link had been clicked
on or not? It isn't there!

Pseudo-class selectors let us style these kinds of changes in our HTML document.
For example, we saw we could change a link's text-decoration property to make it something
other than blue and underlined. Using pseudo selectors, you can control the appearance of
unvisited and visited linksâ€”even links the user is hovering over but hasn't clicked!

---------------------------

Another useful pseudo-class selector is first-child.
It's used to apply styling to only the elements that are the first children of their parents. For instance:

p:first-child {
    color: red;
}
Would make all paragraphs that are the first children of their parent elements red.
