<!-- em relative font size-->

<html>
The font-size unit em is a relative measure: one em is equal to the default
font size on whatever screen the user is using. That makes it great for smartphone
screens, since it doesn't try to tell the smartphone exactly how big to make
a font: it just says, "Hey, 1em is the font size that you normally use, so 2em
is twice as big and 0.5em is half that size!"

"margin border padding content" visual representation

The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin,
the more space between our element and the elements around it.
We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other.

The border is the edge of the element. It's what we've
been making visible every time we set the border property.

The padding is the spacing between the content and the border.
We can adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content.

The content is the actual "stuff" in the box.
If we're talking about a <p> element, the "stuff" is the text of the paragraph.

You'll see abbreviations like TM, TB, and TP in the diagram.
These stand for "top margin," "top border," and "top padding."
As we'll see, we can adjust the top, right, left, and bottom padding, border, and margin individually. -->
