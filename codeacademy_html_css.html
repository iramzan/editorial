<!-- em relative font size-->

<html>
The font-size unit em is a relative measure: one em is equal to the default
font size on whatever screen the user is using. That makes it great for smartphone
screens, since it doesn't try to tell the smartphone exactly how big to make
a font: it just says, "Hey, 1em is the font size that you normally use, so 2em
is twice as big and 0.5em is half that size!"

"margin border padding content" visual representation

The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin,
the more space between our element and the elements around it.
We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other.

The border is the edge of the element. It's what we've
been making visible every time we set the border property.

The padding is the spacing between the content and the border.
We can adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content.

The content is the actual "stuff" in the box.
If we're talking about a <p> element, the "stuff" is the text of the paragraph.

You'll see abbreviations like TM, TB, and TP in the diagram.
These stand for "top margin," "top border," and "top padding."
As we'll see, we can adjust the top, right, left, and bottom padding, border, and margin individually.

---------

For instance, if we take an HTML element with a specific width and set
its margin to auto, this tells the document to automatically put equal
left and right margins on our element, centering it on the page.

---------

If you want to move an element in the other direction,
you can give CSS a negative value: margin-left: -20px will move the element twenty pixels to the left.

---------

If you tell an element to clear: left, it will immediately move below any
floating elements on the left side of the page; it can also clear elements on the right.
If you tell it to clear: both, it will get out of the way of elements floating on the left and right!

POSITIONING
http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4457790/difference-between-style-positionabsolute-and-style-positionrelative

The first type of positioning is ABSOLUTE positioning.
When an element is set to position: absolute, it's then positioned in relation
to the first parent element it has that doesn't have position: static.
If there's no such element, the element with position: absolute gets positioned relative to <html>.

---------

RELATIVE positioning is more straightforward: it tells the element
to move relative to where it would have landed if it just had the default static positioning.

If you give an element relative positioning and tell it to have a margin-top of 10px,
it doesn't move down ten pixels from any particular thing—it moves down ten pixels from where it otherwise would have been.

---------

Finally, FIXED positioning anchors an element to the browser window—you can think of it as gluing the element to the screen.
If you scroll up and down, the fixed element stays put even as other elements scroll past.
